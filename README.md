# Aaron's ICS3U Classwork
I took this course becuase I wanted to do something different compare to other courses in school, something that envolves todays world. I wanted to see if I would be interested in coding and other components of computer science and take it further to univeristy. 

The coding in the old metroid games(how did they make the bosses so complex but simple at the same time, how did they make the bosses have a mind of its own) 

In tatical shooters, how did they code bullets since they have random bullet spray)(this is just for knowledge not for actually implying it to my game)

Mario games, how did they add the platform where mario can jump to and how did they make the secret areas you can go to in the original
